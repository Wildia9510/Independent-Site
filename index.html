  <li><strong id="docs-internal-guid-46d2adeb-7fff-7a3a-f631-880d040cc657" dir="ltr">Training: </strong>You must complete a state-approved barber or cosmetology program lasting at least nine months to become a hairstylist. Barbers must also attend a barber training program. A makeup artist usually attends cosmetology school for several months to a year. Theoreticians must complete a two-year training program that has been approved by the state in which they want to work.</li>
  <li><strong id="docs-internal-guid-46d2adeb-7fff-7a3a-f631-880d040cc657" dir="ltr">Licensure:</strong> Every state in the U.S. requires that hairstylists must be licensed. Barbers must also get state-issued licenses too. You can get a barbering license by completing cosmetology school in some states, but in others, you must get specific training for barbering. Some states combine barbering and cosmetology licenses. Licensing requirements for makeup artists can vary considerably by state, but most do require that theoreticians be licensed as well.</li>
